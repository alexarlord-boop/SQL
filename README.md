# SQL querry optimization

- This is a part of my educational project which I have made during .Net/C# courses at the [Digital Design](https://digdes.ru/) company. 
- I used MS SQL Server Management Studio to analyze and improve query plans.
- I gained skills in designing indexes, fast selects and more.
